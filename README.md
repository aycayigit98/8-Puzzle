# 8-Puzzle
## Solution of 8-Puzzle Problem Using A* Algorithm
### A* Algorithm
A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals
Unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”. What it means is that it is really a smart algorithm which separates it from the other conventional algorithms. This fact is cleared in detail in below sections.
And it is also worth mentioning that many games and web-based maps use this algorithm to find the shortest path very efficiently (approximation).
